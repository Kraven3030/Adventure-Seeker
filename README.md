User Stories
As a routine hiker, I want to use this site to see or share local trails in my area.
As a person who loves the outdoors, this site allows me to be more adventurous.
As someone who likes to plan my hikes accordingly, this site helps me see which ones will be more difficult.

Approach
I wanted to make a app that was simple and clean. The users can esily navigate to where they want to go without any distractions. Also wanted users to feel in complete control of what content that can be displayed on the site when they add hiking trails or campsites.

Unsolved Problems
The homepage styling for mobile devoces doesn't display correctly. This may be due to the image slideshow. Will find a fix eventually so it can have a better for all users no matter the device.
