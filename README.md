USER STORIES:
As a routine hiker, I want to use this site to see or share local trails in my area.

As a person who loves the outdoors, this site allows me to be more adventurous.

As someone who likes to plan my hikes accordingly, this site helps me see which ones will be more difficult.

APPROACH:
I wanted to make a app that was simple and clean. The users can esily navigate to where they want to go without any distractions. Also wanted users to feel in complete control of what content that can be displayed on the site when they add hiking trails or campsites.

TROUBLES: 
Geeting the modals to display for a specific trail or campsite was difficult at first. Before solving, whenever you clicked edit button, all modals dispalyed instead of a single one.
